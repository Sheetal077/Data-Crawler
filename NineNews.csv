3,"Boris Johnson says COVID-19 restrictions to ease, UK must live with virus",2021-07-08 00:00:00.000000,"British Prime Minister Boris Johnson confirmed Monday that his government plans to scrap laws requiring face masks and social distancing later this month, though he acknowledged that lifting the restrictions will drive surging coronavirus cases even higher./nJohnson said legal controls will be replaced by ""personal responsibility"" when the country moves to the final stage of its lockdown-lifting roadmap. That is scheduled to happen on July 19, though Johnson said a final decision would come on July 12./nThe change will mean people can throw away masks after months of enforced face-covering, though businesses and transit operators may still require them, and they will still be recommended in some enclosed spaces./nThe removal of social distancing rules will allow nightclubs to reopen after 16 months of enforced shutdown, and patrons to once again order drinks at the bar in a pub. No longer will customers have to scan a phone app to provide their contact details when entering a restaurant or bar./nThe government will also stop instructing people to work from home if they can, leaving employers free to bring staff back to offices./nThe changes apply in England. Other parts of the UK — Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland — are following their own, broadly similar, road maps out of lockdown./nBritain has recorded more than 128,000 coronavirus deaths, the highest toll in Western Europe, and infections are rising due to the highly transmissible delta variant of the virus. Confirmed cases have shot up from about 2000 a day earlier this year to 25,000 a day in the past week. But the number of deaths is broadly stable, at fewer than 20 a day./nPublic health officials say Britain's vaccination program has weakened the link between infections and deaths, though not severed it. So far, 86 per cent of UK adults have received at least one vaccine dose and 64 per cent are fully vaccinated. The government aims to give everyone over 18 both shots by mid-September./nJohnson acknowledged that infections, hospitalisations and deaths will all rise once remaining restrictions are lifted./n""I want to stress from the outset that this pandemic is far from over,"" he said, predicting that cases could hit 50,000 a day by July 19. ""We must reconcile ourselves, sadly, to more deaths from COVID.""/nJohnson said Britain would have to ""learn to live with this virus"" — a major shift in tone from a leader who has previously painted COVID-19 as an enemy to be vanquished./nThat message will be welcomed by lockdown-skeptic lawmakers in Johnson's governing Conservative Party, who say the economic and social damage of restrictions outweighs the public health benefits, and Britain's populist press, which have dubbed July 19 ""freedom day.""/nBut public health officials and scientists have urged caution, saying ditching masks and social distancing altogether could be dangerous. Psychologist Stephen Reicher, a member of the government's scientific advisory committee, said ""proportionate mitigations"" against the spread of the virus should stay in place./n""I think we need very clear messaging and I think in certain spaces — crowded, badly ventilated spaces — masks are crucial mitigation,"" he told the BBC./nThe British government, which enforced one of the longest lockdowns in the world, has lifted restrictions for England in a series of steps that began with reopening schools in March. The fourth and final stage was delayed last month to provide time for more people to be vaccinated amid the rapid spread of the delta variant, which was first discovered in India./nJonathan Ashworth, health spokesman for the opposition Labour Party, said the government should exercise more caution./n""We're not out of the woods,"" he said. ""We want to see the lockdown end but we need lifesaving mitigation in place. We still need sick pay, local contact tracing, continued mask wearing, ventilation and support for children to prevent serious illness.""/nPaul Hunter, professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia, said it made sense to ease restrictions in summer, when schools are closed, people spend more time outdoors and other respiratory infections are at a low level./n""The disease burden associated with a larger peak during the summer would likely be less than one during the winter,"" Hunter said./nBut Richard Tedder, a virologist at Imperial College London, said easing up while infections are still rampant ""comes with the very real risk of facilitating the escape of variants which will be even more resistant to vaccines and potentially more infectious./n""Failing to recognise this is playing with fire,"" he said.",https://www.9news.com.au/world/uk-coronavirus-restrictions-to-ease-must-live-with-virus-boris-johnson-says/0d113cd5-7fab-4357-8373-0a074bd5be0f
4,NSA discloses hacking methods it says are used by Russia,2021-07-12 00:00:00.000000,"US and British agencies have disclosed details of “brute force” methods they say were used by/nRussian/nintelligence to try to break into the cloud services of hundreds of government agencies, energy companies and other organisations./nAn advisory released by the US National Security Agency describes attacks by operatives linked to the GRU, the Russian military intelligence agency, which has been previously tied to major/ncyberattacks/nabroad and efforts to disrupt the 2016 and 2020 American elections./nIn a statement, NSA Cybersecurity Director Rob Joyce said the campaign was “likely ongoing, on a global scale.”/nREAD MORE:/nExperts warn Australian Cyberattacks to grow exponentially/nREAD MORE:/nRussia tests giant nuclear submarine equipped with secret weapons/nBrute force attacks involve the automated spraying of sites with potential passwords until hackers gain access./nThe advisory urges companies to adopt methods long urged by experts as common-sense cyber hygiene, including the use of multi-factor authentication and mandating strong passwords./nIssued during a devastating wave of ransomware attacks on governments and key infrastructure, the advisory does not disclose specific targets of the campaign or its presumed purpose, saying only that hackers have targeted hundreds of organisations worldwide./nThe NSA said GRU-linked operatives have tried to break into networks using Kubernetes, an open-source tool originally developed by Google to manage cloud services, since at least mid-2019 through early this year./nWhile a “significant amount” of the attempted break-ins targeted organisations using Microsoft's Office 365 cloud services, the hackers went after other cloud providers and email servers as well, the NSA said./nThe US has long accused Russia of using and tolerating cyberattacks for espionage, spreading disinformation, and the disruption of governments and key infrastructure./nThe Russian Embassy in Washington on Thursday “strictly” denied the involvement of Russian government agencies in cyberattacks on US government agencies or private companies./nIn a statement posted on Facebook, the embassy said, “We hope that the American side will abandon the practice of unfounded accusations and focus on professional work with Russian experts to strengthen international information security.”/nJoe Slowik, a threat analyst at the network-monitoring firm Gigamon, said the activity described by NSA on Thursday shows the GRU has further streamlined an already popular technique for breaking into networks./nHe said it appears to overlap with Department of Energy reporting on brute force intrusion attempts in late 2019 and early 2020 targeting the US energy and government sectors and is something the US government has apparently been aware of for some time./nSlowik said the use of Kubernetes “is certainly a bit unique, although on its own it doesn’t appear worrying.”/nHe said the brute force method and lateral movement inside networks described by NSA are common among state-backed hackers and criminal ransomware gangs, allowing the GRU to blend in with other actors./nJohn Hultquist, vice president of analysis at the cybersecurity firm Mandiant, characterised the activity described in the advisory as “routine collection against policy makers, diplomats, the military, and the defence industry.”/n“This is a good reminder that the GRU remains a looming threat, which is especially important given the upcoming Olympics, an event they may well attempt to disrupt,” Hultquist said in a statement./nThe FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency joined the advisory, as did the British National Cyber Security Centre./nThe GRU has been repeatedly linked by US officials in recent years to a series of hacking incidents./nIn 2018, special counsel Robert Mueller’s office charged 12 military intelligence officers with hacking Democratic emails that were then released by WikiLeaks in an effort to harm Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign and boost Donald Trump’s bid./nMore recently, the Justice Department announced charges last fall against GRU officers in cyberattacks that targeted a French presidential election, the Winter Olympics in South Korea and American businesses./nUnlike Russia’s foreign intelligence agency SVR, which is blamed for the SolarWinds hacking campaign and is careful not to be detected in its cyber ops, the GRU has carried out the most damaging cyberattacks on record, including two on Ukraine’s power grid and the 2017 NotPetya virus that caused more than US$10 billion in damage globally./nGRU operatives have also been involved in the spread of disinformation related to the coronavirus pandemic, US officials have alleged./nAnd an American intelligence assessment in March says the GRU tried to monitor people in US politics in 2019 and 2020 and staged a phishing campaign against subsidiaries of the Ukrainian energy company Burisma, likely to gather information damaging to President/nJoe Biden/n, whose son had earlier served on the board./nThe Biden administration in April sanctioned Russia after linking it to election interference and the SolarWinds breach.",https://www.9news.com.au/world/nsa-discloses-hacking-methods-used-by-russia-in-cyber-attacks/8b96db18-49d4-4649-9973-9b9d43905e1c

But it's going to take a lot more than words to curb the advance of the world's second largest economy./nThe US joined the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy and Canada this weekend to deliver the Group of Seven's strongest condemnation of China in recent decades./nThe/nG7 confronted China on just about every sore spot/n, from allegations of human rights abuses and forced labour in Xinjiang to ongoing political disputes over Hong Kong, Taiwan and the South China Sea./nREAD MORE:/n/nG7 leaders back Australia on facing down China trade threats/nThe world's wealthiest democracies also pushed for a renewed independent investigation into the origins of COVID-19 and promoted a green alternative to China's Belt and Road, Chinese President Xi Jinping's expansive plan to boost its trading influence./nThe rhetoric, at least, is a step forward for a US president who has been trying to bring his diplomatic partners together to counter what Washington sees as its biggest threat to trade, tech and other issues of strategic importance./nFormer US President Donald Trump talked tough on China and slapped the country and its prized companies with sanctions./nBut Trump never really presented a united front with US allies, often burning bridges rather than building them./nThe G7's announcement doesn't include many concrete steps forward./nFor example, the group is forming a task force to explore what it called the ""Build Back Better World"" initiative — a private-sector led plan to ""help narrow the $40+ trillion infrastructure need in the developing world"" that's clearly set up as a challenge to Belt and Road. But it has yet to lay out how much the program would cost, which is expected to be funded by US government finance groups, the private sector and the G7 countries./nSimilarly, the communique's calls for China to ""respect human rights and fundamental freedoms"" in Xinjiang and Hong Kong came with little detail on how to follow through with action, nor did it offer any practical means of safeguarding the stability of the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea./nREAD MORE:/n/nChinese cartoon mocking G7 leaders goes viral online/nChina still fired back against the statement, accusing the G7 of deliberately slandering China"" and ""arbitrarily interfering in China's internal affairs.""/nThe Chinese Embassy in London called it ""a serious violation of the basic norms of international relations.""/nThere are a couple of reasons Beijing should be watching its back./nSome Trump-era sanctions were effective at curtailing China's technological rise — look, for example, at its campaign against Huawei, which watched as its smartphone and 5G businesses were battered by restricting its access to American tech, along with US pressures on Europe and elsewhere to bar the company from extending its reach./nUnder Biden, the United States recently expanded a ban on American investment in dozens of Chinese firms./nAnd US lawmakers are advancing a bill that would pour hundreds of billions of dollars into American technology, science and research in yet another challenge to China./n""Irreconcilable differences regarding values and growing frictions with China's mercantilist and authoritarian model will continue to drive polarisation and competition,"" said Alex Capri, a research fellow at Hinrich Foundation and a visiting senior fellow at the National University of Singapore./nHe added that ""values-driven"" frameworks from the West around infrastructure development, trade and supply chain networks were ""clearly emerging.""/n""Human rights standards around privacy and freedom of speech, fair labour standards and a clean environment will serve to further alienate Beijing,"" Mr Capri said./nSuch tensions have already played out on a global stage, with many Western companies facing pressure to limit business in China because of concerns about forced labour./nIn turn, some firms have faced boycotts within China for denouncing the government's handling of Xinjiang./nAnd just before the G7 summit kicked off, China passed a law to counter foreign sanctions, a symbolic warning that any countermeasures taken by the West would be met with strong retaliation./nEven so, it may be tough for the G7 nations to contain China. This weekend, democratic leaders aired serious differences over how best to approach China, as the United States, Britain and Canada urged stronger action against China's authoritarianism than their allies did./nEuropean countries' reluctance to go too hard on China may stem in part from a strong economic reliance: From 2010 to 2019, Germany received €22.7 billion ($35.7 billion) in Chinese foreign direct investment, while Italy received €15.9 billion ($25 billion) and France received €14.4 billion ($22.6 billion), according to the Mecrator Institute of China Studies./nEven the UK — where relationships with China have been deeply strained over the last couple of years — received €50.3 billion ($79 billion) in such investment./nAnd many of those countries, like Germany, rely on partnerships with China to drive other industries, such as autos, and to provide huge markets for their exports./n""Ultimately, the European Union's desire for strategic autonomy and Biden's hunt for allies to primarily counter China will create natural barriers to cooperation,"" analysts at Eurasia Group wrote in a note last week ahead of Biden's trip./nYou can find out more details about how to book your vaccine/n/nthrough the Federal Government health site here./nNectar Gan/nNectar Gan is a digital producer for CNN International based in Hong Kong.",https://www.9news.com.au/national/g7-2021-us-china-the-west-is-uniting-to-confront-china-how-worried-should-beijing-be/27170507-8fc4-4fe5-b53f-9eeb9c0efae2

You're given a choice to play as the male or female version of the main character, Eivor. It's a significant step up to the previous/nAssassin's Creed/ntitle,/nOdyssey/n(2018).

Interacting with simple doors and chests can be a bit underwhelming, your character lightly waves their hand and the golden chest of loot is emptied into their bag.

Large scale combat, such as raiding a village, gets the adrenaline pumping. Whether you choose to stay with your army to fight the battle or run straight to the main objective, the option is yours.

It was the honour of his career to bring King T'Challa to life in Black Panther.""/nBorn in South Carolina, Boseman graduated from Howard University and had small roles in television before his first star turn in 2013./nHis striking portrayal of the stoic baseball star Robinson opposite Harrison Ford in 2013′s ""42"" drew attention in Hollywood./nBoseman died on a day that Major League Baseball was celebrating Jackie Robinson day./n""This is a crushing blow"" actor and director Jordan Peele said on Twitter, one of many expressing shock as the news spread across social media./n""This broke me,"" said actor and writer Issa Rae./nHis T'Challa character was first introduced to the blockbuster Marvel movies in 2016′s ""Captain America: Civil War,"" and his ""Wakanda Forever"" salute reverberated around the world after the release of ""Black Panther"" two years ago./nThe film's vision of Afrofuturism and the technologically advanced civilisation of Wakanda resonated with audiences, some of whom wore African attire to showings and helped propel ""Black Panther"" to more than US$1.3 billion in global box office. It is the only Marvel Studios film to receive a best picture Oscar nomination./nThe character was last seen standing silently dressed in a black suit at Tony Stark's funeral in last year's ""Avengers: Endgame."" A ""Black Panther"" sequel had been announced, and was one of the studio's most anticipated upcoming films./nEven at the outset of his Hollywood career, Boseman was clear-eyed about — and even sceptical of — the industry in which he would become an international star./n""You don't have the same exact experience as a Black actor as you do as a white actor. You don't have the same opportunities. That's evident and true,"" he told AP while promoting ""42.""/n""The best way to put it is: How often do you see a movie about a black hero who has a love story ... he has a spirituality. He has an intellect. It's weird to say it, but it doesn't happen that often.""/nIn addition to Robinson and Brown, Boseman portrayed the future US Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall in 2017′s ""Marshall."" He humanised the larger-than-life historical figures with the same quiet dignity — interrupted by flashes of sparkling wit — that he would later bring to T'Challa./nHe took on his first producing job in last year's action thriller ""21 Bridges,"" in which he also starred, and was last seen on-screen in Spike Lee's film ""Da 5 Bloods"" as the leader of a group of Black soldiers in the Vietnam War./nIt took some time for Boseman's moment to come. He first got into theatre, acting and writing plays as an undergrad at Howard. Boseman had roles on TV shows like ABC Family's ""Lincoln Heights"" and NBC's ""Persons Unknown,"" but before ""42"" he had only acted in one film, 2008's football drama ""The Express."" Boseman attracted notice, but missed out on big parts./n""2011 was a rough year,"" he said. ""I was up for everything that was happening that year, really good roles. I would get down to the end and then it would go to someone else.""/nBoseman completed one last performance, in an adaptation of August Wilson's ""Ma Rainey's Black Bottom."" The Netflix film, in which Boseman stars alongside Viola Davis, finished shooting last summer./nAsked about his own childhood heroes and icons, Boseman cited Black political leaders and musicians: Malcolm X, Martin Luther King Jr., Bob Marley, Public Enemy, A Tribe Called Quest and Prince. Deeply private and often guarded in his public appearances and interviews, he made clear that he understood the significance of his work and its impact on the broader culture./nAt the 2019 Screen Actors Guild Award, ""Black Panther"" won best ensemble, electrifying the room. Before an auditorium full of actors, Chadwick Boseman stepped to the microphone. He quoted Nina Simone: ""To be young, gifted and black,"" then put the moment in context./n""We know what it's like to be told there isn't a screen for you to be featured on, a stage for you to be featured on. ... We know what's like to be beneath and not above. And that is what we went to work with every day,"" said Boseman. ""We knew that we could create a world that exemplified a world we wanted to see. We knew that we had something to give.""",https://www.9news.com.au/world/black-panther-star-chadwick-boseman-dies-of-cancer-aged-43/5bb0805a-09de-4b55-8f05-7b7b1e6fffbf

129,'Unbreakable' headset and compact controller nigh on perfect with Dolby Atmos,2021-07-07 00:00:00.000000,"It's almost a pair matched in heaven, the latest headset and controller by RIG certainly look the part - but one without the other doesn't quite hit the mark./nNew-gen gaming relies on a beefy sound system or set of headphones to shine, but that's tough to do on a budget./nWhat if you could get incredible sound with a little boost from your controller? The latest headset and controller from Nacon/RIG do just that./nRIG PRO Compact Controller/nFirst impressions, as expected by the name - it's small. It may not look like it at first glance, but it wasn't the best fit in my hands compared to other Xbox controllers./nThe controller's handles are slightly too short, pinkie fingers miss out on a spot to rest and slip off the bottom./nThe controller has a nice finish, a slightly textured grip covers the controller./nThe triggers and bumpers spring back nicely and the vibrations in the triggers when performing actions are excellent./nAll other buttons are responsive and smooth. Although the A, B, Y and X buttons are clicky. The thumbsticks, while small, fit well under my thumbs./nAwkwardly placed on the controller is the share button, but in RIG's defence they have designed this controller specifically for competitive gaming - sharing isn't top priority here./nOne of it's biggest flaws, if I could even call it that, is it's a wired controller with a chunky 3 metre cable./nIt's durable, that's for certain, but the cable looks like a mess when draped across the loungeroom - it almost takes me back to the original Xbox./nBut there's a good reason, which I'll get to shortly, as to why that cable's there and it's the reason I rate this RIG duo so highly./nThe controller is completely customizable, from buttons to trigger and stick sensitivity. The RIG Pro Compact has software to set the controller to exactly how you like it./nA 3.5mm headphone jack can be found at the base of the controller. It's this piece of tech that holds the key to the product's success./nYou can pick up the RIG PRO Compact in store now for $89.99./nAnd the kicker is…/nIt's the world's first controller with Dolby Atmos included./nRIG 500 PRO GEN 2 Headset/nStraight out of the box the RIG 500 PRO GEN 2 looks and feels great./nThe headset is comfortable and light, you can easily forget you're wearing it./nRIG claims their headsets are ""unbreakable"" and I'll be honest, I didn't try to find out./nBut if the steel band, a first for the RIG brand, is anything to go by - it's a tough piece of tech./nIt also has a self-adjusting strap, so no matter the size of your head you should be fine./nMuch like many modern day headsets, the microphone can be turned on and off by lifting it up or down. You can also completely remove the microphone if you have no need for it./nI did find the cable connecting the microphone to the headset was a bit soft to move, but still managed to produce great sound with a recording test./nThe flat cable connection between the headphones and controller is neat, it's light and looks modern./nThere's no buttons or knobs on the headset itself but you will find a volume control slider on the headphone cable./nTo really test Dolby Atmos I jumped into/nOri and the Will of the Wisps/n. It's one of few Xbox titles to fully support/nDolby Atmos/n./nEach crack of lightning, every song could be felt through the/nRIG 500 Gen 2/n./nDolby Atmos/nand 3D audio is the future of gaming and film, it's essentially second to graphical enhancements in video games./nBeing able to hear things at a distance, behind you and above you is truly immersive./nThe headset includes a subscription for/nDolby Atmos/nfor the shelf life of the product, alone this would cost about $25./nYou'll need to enter the download code, which comes in the packaging, on your/nXbox/nto install the/nDolby Atmos/nsoftware. You'll need to do the same on PC./nThe good thing about this headset is it'll work with pretty much any device that takes 3.5mm connection. That includes the/nXbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PS4 and PS5/n./nThe RIG 500 PRO Gen 2 is releasing on August 1 and will retail for about $130./nOverall, the headset is the front runner in the RIG duo. The controller alone, while Dolby Atmos ready, is simply a basic, small third-party controller with the added bonus of Dolby Atmos support. But when you combine the two, it's a glorious fusion of sound and gaming./n9News was also given a teaser for another Nacon controller coming later this year, but details were limited. We'll bring you all the latest on this when it comes to hand./nThe RIG PRO 500 and RIG PRO Compact were supplied to 9News.com.au for the purpose of this review.",https://www.9news.com.au/technology/review-controller-headset-rig-pro-500-rig-pro-compact/0354efa8-2a63-4bd1-9ec6-140ee45ca564
130,Major airline's $3.92 billion bid to bring back speed-of-sound travel,2021-07-08 00:00:00.000000,"United Airlines aims to bring back supersonic travel before the decade is over with a/nplane/nthat is currently just an artist's drawing — even the prototype hasn't flown yet./nThe airline said today that it plans to buy 15 jets from Boom Supersonic with an option for 35 more once the start-up company designs a plane that flies faster than the speed of sound while meeting safety and environmental standards./nUnited hopes to carry passengers on the plane in 2029. The airline said the plane will reduce flights between London and the New York area to just three and a half hours and make Tokyo only six hours from San Francisco./nREAD MORE:/n/nWorld's largest aircraft by wingspan takes off/nUnited declined to discuss financial terms, but Boom CEO Blake Scholl said the deal was worth US$3 billion ($3.92 billion), or US$200 million ($261.2 million) per plane with none of the discounting that is typical in the aircraft business./nIt has been nearly two decades since the last flight of the supersonic Concorde, which British Airways and Air France began using in 1976 to zip passengers in luxury across the Atlantic./nThe last one was retired in 2003, three years after an Air France Concorde crashed into a hotel shortly after takeoff from Paris, killing everyone on board and four people on the ground./nSeveral companies are working to come up with new supersonic jets that would be more economical on fuel — and create fewer climate-changing emissions — than the Concorde./nBoom is working to develop an 88-seat plane it calls Overture, which it says will be the first supersonic airliner to fly on so-called sustainable fuel. Mr Scholl said that a one-third sized prototype will make its first test flight later this year or early in 2022./nThe Denver company said the plane will be capable of speeds up to 1.7 times the speed of sound, or about 2092km/hr. That is slower than the Concorde but more than twice as fast as many current airliners./nThe endorsement from United is a huge lift for Boom. Another supersonic contender, Aerion, said last month that it was running short of money to get its plane, the AS2, into production./nSupersonic jets are often banned over populated areas because of the sonic booms they create. That eliminates many potential overland routes because the planes would have to fly at less efficient subsonic speeds./nChicago-based United believes that its coastal hubs in San Francisco and Newark, New Jersey, and its corporate-traveller clientele make it better suited than its rivals to offer supersonic service./nREAD MORE:/n/nTeen stowaway survives international flight clinging to landing gear/nMike Leskinen, United's vice president of corporate development and a former aerospace analyst, said United hopes to offer both premium and economy seating but that no final decisions have been made on cabin layout./nUnited is sensitive about the high fares that helped doom the Concorde, and is trusting that the cost to operate the Boom plane will come down over time as it has for other jets./nThe Concorde was the pride of British and French aircraft companies, and it ushered in a new era of rapid travel over long distances. The plane had a distinctive delta-wing design that made it easily recognisable as it streaked overhead on its way to New York or Dulles Airport outside Washington./nDespite its cachet, the plane never caught on widely. The sonic booms limited its routes over land, and its high costs and relatively small size compared with other jets made tickets too expensive for anyone other than the wealthy or well-connected./nHenry Harteveldt, a travel analyst for Atmosphere Research, said the Boom jet appears targeted at business flyers, but corporations are trying to cut travel spending and might resist putting employees on supersonic flights if the fares are too high./nMr Scholl said the Boom jet will be 75 percent cheaper to operate than the Concorde thanks to decades of advancements in engines and lighter fuselages./n""This is going to be a ticket that's affordable to way more people than supersonic ever has been before,"" Mr Scholl said./nREAD MORE:/n/nBoeing 737 Max aircraft cleared to fly again/nHe predicted that the speed of supersonic flight would revolutionise air travel the way that jets replaced most large propeller-driven planes./nNot everyone who follows aviation is convinced, noting that developing a new plane costs many billions of dollars./nRichard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst at Teal Group, said he believes that if there were a profitable market for supersonic airliners, Boeing and Airbus would be building them./n""It tells you that the enormous, established players don't see it,"" he said./n""There is no reason they couldn't do this. There is no secret sauce that Boom keeps in a safe somewhere.""",https://www.9news.com.au/technology/supersonic-flight-united-airlines-purchases-prototype-jets/9ea61741-be56-4ea7-8b53-d73cc946f195

allow researchers to watch what genes are being turned on or off to help the tardigrades survive./nFor example, if researchers determine that tardigrades are producing a lot of antioxidants to help combat the level of radiation they're experiencing, that could tell researchers that astronauts need to eat a more antioxidant-enriched diet./n""Ultimately this information will give us insights into

137,The tiny little cables that keep New Zealand connected to the world,2021-05-12 00:00:00.000000,"A bit like a spider web attached to a tree,/nNew Zealand's/ninternet network hangs off just 20 strands of glass fibre, each about the thickness of a human hair./nThose glass fibres, contained in four submarine cables connecting New Zealand to the United States and Australia, carry virtually all communications to and from the country./nCut them all, and InternetNZ chief security officer Sam Sargeant says most of the modern technology systems the country relied on for work and play would stop working./nREAD MORE:/n/nHow to tell if your smartphone is spying on you/n""Going to Facebook, logging on to Gmail, accessing some Microsoft services – these are all services that go across these cables,"" he said./nBecause so many systems and services are hosted overseas in the era of cloud computing, even sending an email to their next-door neighbour would probably be impossible for a New Zealander./nThe ""weird interconnected"" nature of modern systems means no-one knows exactly what services might survive, and that would be hard to test without pulling the plug, Mr Sargeant said./n""The systems we use to buy gas at the petrol station may require a global corporate connection and, if that goes down, can you buy petrol? Let's hope so,"" he said./nHow long has NZ relied on these cables?/nSubmarine cables aren't an engineering achievement that came in the order one might expect./nThe first transcontinental cable was laid between Britain and the United States in 1858, allowing telegrams to be sent between the countries for the first time using Morse code along its seven twisted copper wires./nQueen Victoria and US president James Buchanan used it to exchange telegrams several years before the invention of the humble stapler in 1877, and 18 years before anyone stepped into anything resembling a motor car./nREAD MORE:/n/nWorld-first laser to shunt deadly space junk out of orbit/nNow the world's oceans are criss-crossed by more than a million kilometres of submarine cables, linking billions of kilometres of fibre on land./nThe more modern submarine cables, laid after about 1988, contain several strands of glass fibre, rather than a copper wire, to carry their traffic./nHow do they work?/nThe way fibre-optic cables transmit information is by having light shone down them that can be detected at the other end, in the same way that you might communicate with someone using a torch across a darkened field at night./nThe modern miracle is not so much the cables themselves, but the lasers and switching equipment at either end of the cables that can flick on and off and detect those flashes of light, in different wavelengths, at mind-boggling speeds./nIt is that optical electronics, along with the number of strands of fibre, that determines how much information a cable can carry./nAt the moment, the highest-capacity submarine cables have transfer rates in the tens of terabits, but as faster switching equipment is developed and commercialised that should further increase, allowing both new and sometimes also existing cables to carry more data./nThis year, researchers in Japan reportedly sent a petabit (1000 terabits) of data down a single optical fibre in a second./nThat's enough bandwidth in theory to transfer all the works of William Shakespeare to 250,000 different people in a hundredth of a second (uncompressed), or to simultaneously stream Netflix in HD to 200 million people./nREAD MORE:/n/nThe first-ever tweet sold as an NFT for $3.8 million/nIf they are glass, will they last forever?/nIf a few strands of glass fibre were all that submarine cables comprised of, then they might last almost forever, but sadly that's not the case./nThe light signals they carry need a boost about every 60km, using ""repeaters"" that are attached to every undersea cable, just as you might need a plug-in device to extend a wi-fi signal to a distant corner of your home./nThe repeaters need power to provide that boost, which means every submarine fibre-optic cable also carries a copper power cable alongside its fibre strands./nThat equipment limits the working life of cables to a few decades./nPower for the repeaters is usually provided by diesel generators at landing stations along the way, which has the practical effect that undersea cables need to come ashore about every 10,000km./nREAD MORE:/n/nSpeed boost for 900,000 inferior NBN internet connections/nHow are they laid?/nA few things haven't changed much since the 19th century./nAs there is no machine to do it, cables – sometimes thousands of kilometres long – are wound by hand around huge spools in special cable-laying ships, like giant spools of cotton, in a process that can take several laborious weeks, before they are lowered on to the seabed./nThe final few kilometres before they come ashore are usually buried, to protect them from being dragged up and cut by ship anchors./nWhat is their economic significance?/nThe most meaningful measure perhaps is that submarine cables underpin pretty much all international communications that take place today, and most have large amounts of ""unlit"" excess capacity./nThat capacity is the reason people can now video-call friends and relatives on the other side of the world for free, using services such as Skype and WhatsApp​./nWithout fibre-optic submarine cables, that just wouldn't be possible./nPhone calls, internet traffic and television pictures can be relayed from one continent to another by satellites in space, but not nearly as cheaply or efficiently, so subsea cables are here to stay./nSubsea cables can cost tens of millions to many hundreds of millions of dollars, depending on their length./nSo traditionally they have been laid by large telecommunications companies such as – in this neck of the woods – Telstra​, Optus, TGP and Spark./nBut cloud computing giants such as Google, Microsoft and Amazon have increasingly been getting in on the act to help link their global data centres./nWho's behind NZ's cables?/nThe first modern fibre-optic network connecting New Zealand with Australia and the US, the Southern Cross Cable Network, shaped in a figure of eight centred on Hawaii, was completed by a Spark-led joint venture in 2000 at a cost of US$1.3 billion ($1.68 billion)./nFor many years it held a near monopoly on the flow of traffic to and from New Zealand./nBut in the past few years there has been a flurry of activity./nIn 2017, Spark, Vodafone and Telstra clubbed together to build an extra fibre line, the Tasman Global Access cable, to Australia./nThe following year, independent operator Hawaiki Cable completed a NZ$500m ($464 million) cable to the US and Australia./nHawaiki is now hoping to lay the first international submarine cable from the South Island, to Sydney and Melbourne, to support its investment in a huge data centre near Invercargill./nAnd Southern Cross is refreshing its network with its new Next trans-Pacific cable due to be in service next year./nAre they reliable?/nAfter the first transatlantic telegrams were sent in 1858, there was a large street parade on Broadway in New York to celebrate, and unused sections of the cable were chopped up to make popular souvenirs./nNowadays people are only likely to pay much attention to submarine cables if they suddenly stop working, which is a very rare occurrence./nAnd that's just as well, as it could take weeks to send a specialist repair ship to fix a cable if it broke far out to sea./nEarthquakes, as well as ship anchors, have damaged and broken submarine cables, but that's unusual, and New Zealand now has enough cables coming ashore in different places, with enough excess capacity, for no single outage to risk sending the country back to the pre-internet age./nIf a single cable was knocked out of action, communications traffic could quite easily be rerouted, though it might run slower./nBut if they were all suddenly cut, that would be pretty much it for the internet until they were fixed./nWhat are the risks of that?/nAccording to Britain's/nEnglish Historical Review/n, Britain's very first military action after declaring war on Germany in World War I was to cut five cables linking Germany with France, Spain and the Azores./nAnd in recent years, concerns have grown that subsea cable could become an easy target in a global conflict that perhaps fell short of an actual war./nThere is evidence also that subsea cables have been spied on, or at least that the ability to interfere with them has been tested./nThe Russian spy ship Yantar and the US nuclear submarine Jimmy Carter are two of the vessels that are believed to have been modified specifically for such operations./nSurprisingly, it can be possible to ""read"" the data on a fibre-optic cable by bending it and detecting the tiny amount of light that will travel straight ahead and leak out through its plastic casing./nBut then any submarine spy has got the challenge of how to make sense of all those terabits of encrypted data, deep under the ocean./nInternetNZ's Mr Sargeant has another concern./nThe ransomware attack on the Colonial Pipeline fuel pipeline in the US earlier this month shows how critical infrastructure can be attacked by ""talented criminal groups"", he said./nThe implications of submarine cable operators suffering a similar fate are reducing as the number of cables to New Zealand increases and the risk of a successful attack is remote, he said./n""But having said that, it is not impossible,"" he said./nThis story originally appeared on/n/nStuff.co.nz/n/nand has been

145,Twitter ditches 'biased' image-cropping algorithm,2021-05-12 00:00:00.000000,"Twitter/nhas largely abandoned an image-cropping algorithm after determining the automated system was biased. Some users complained it had a preference toward showing pictures of white people in previews of tweets./nIn a blog post today, Rumman Chowdhury, a software engineering director for Twitter's machine learning ethics, transparency and accountability team, wrote that the company concluded the algorithm was biased after testing it for gender- and race-based biases./nThe post and an accompanying research paper detail how the cropping system, when tested on randomly linked images of people of various races and genders, favoured White people over Black people and women over men, for instance./nREAD MORE:/nTwitter's blue tick system about to relaunch, researcher claims/nLIVE UPDATES:/n/nAll the latest breaking news in Australia and around the world/nTwitter's conclusion comes months after the company said it would look into the algorithm, and serves as yet another example of how bias can creep into computer systems that are meant to perform tasks that humans are often uniquely good at doing./n""We considered the tradeoffs between the speed and consistency of automated cropping with the potential risks we saw in this research,"" Mr Chowdhury wrote./n""One of our conclusions is that not everything on Twitter is a good candidate for an algorithm, and in this case, how to crop an image is a decision best made by people.""/nIn March, Twitter started testing a new way to show a full image — rather than an automatically cropped preview version — on mobile devices when a user tweeted a single image./nThe company said that, following positive feedback, it rolled out the feature to all its iOS and Android users in May. (It center-crops images that are extremely long or wide, however)./nA Twitter spokesperson told CNN Business that the change came to Twitter's mobile app first since that's how most people tweet and look at images./nWhen the image-cropping algorithm was in place, any time a user posted an image to Twitter, the automated system would crop a preview version of that image that viewers would see before clicking through to the full-size image./nTwitter said in a blog post in 2018 that it previously used face detection to help figure out how to crop images for previews./nREAD MORE:/n2021 iPad Pro review: How Apple is changing video calling/nHowever, the face-detecting software was prone to errors. The company scrapped that approach and instead had its software home in on what's known as ""saliency"" in pictures, or the area considered most interesting to a person looking at the overall image./nSaliency is studied by tracking what people look at; we tend to be interested in things like people, animals, and text, for instance./nLast September the company was prompted to study its algorithmic approach to cropping images after numerous tweets criticized it. These included one from Twitter user @bascule, who on September 19 tweeted, ""Trying a horrible experiment... Which will the Twitter algorithm pick: Mitch McConnell or Barack Obama?"" Along with his words were two long, rectangular images./nThe first consisted of a picture of US Senate majority leader McConnell on the top, who is White, with a slender white rectangle in the middle, and a picture of former US President Obama, who is Black, at the bottom. The second featured the opposite, with Obama at the top and McConnell at the bottom. With Twitter's image-cropping algorithm in use, preview versions of the images, which are side by side, show just Mr McConnell./nA day earlier, another Twitter user, @colinmadland, noticed a similar preview result when he posted a picture that he said showed himself, a White man, next to a picture of a Black man with whom he attended an online meeting; Twitter's preview defaulted to showing just the White man./nIn a response to @bascule at the time, the company tweeted that it didn't see evidence of racial or gender bias during testing before releasing the preview feature, but said it would look into whether there were issues with the cropping algorithm./nREAD MORE:/n/nDonald Trump launches his own blog in the wake of Twitter ban/nIn Twitter's blog post, Mr Chowdhury wrote that the move away from using an algorithm to crop images lowers the company's dependency on machine learning (an artificial intelligence technique where a computer teaches itself by poring over data) ""for a function that we agree is best performed by people using our products.""/nThe Twitter spokesperson said the company plans to dump the image-cropping algorithm on the Twitter.com website in the next few months./nThe algorithm is also used in a couple other ways, such as when a person tweets multiple images; the spokesperson said Twitter is working on improvements for those uses, too.",https://www.9news.com.au/technology/twitter-abandons-automated-image-cropping-algorithm-calling-it-biased/490fae9e-7a87-478d-ba21-9a5abe3dfc72
146,2021 Apple iPad Pro review: Laptop performance and video calls on Centre Stage,2021-07-12 00:00:00.000000,"Video calls are going to look very different for those people using the new Apple iPad Pro, with a feature called ""Centre Stage"" set to make it look like you've got your very own camera operator no matter where you're calling from./nThe idea is that the iPad's smarts analyse the video and essentially zoom and pan around the wider fixed image to give the impression of movement from a device that is sitting still./nThis might not mean much, but for people doing any form of demonstration or hosting video calls while doing other things, it's a winner. It's the key software feature of the iPad Pro for 2021./nREAD MORE:/n/nApple's new iMacs - the ultimate family computer/nHowever, it's far from the only new feature. 5G connectivity comes to the iPad Pro after launching in Apple's lineup with the iPhone 12 late last year. Frankly, that alone could have warranted a model upgrade, but instead it's one of many new features./nThe USB-C port is now Thunderbolt-enabled. That allowed me to do a fast data transfer of video files, which then sat comfortably on the massive 2TB storage (an option if you're prepared to pay for it). Though with Thunderbolt connectivity, you could edit files and video off an external drive without needing the storage on-device./nThe design is the same, though the Magic Keyboard accessory now comes in white, which looks amazing — but ask me again in a few months and we'll see how clean it is./nA stunning screen, which Apple is calling a Liquid Retina XDR display, is the standout visual feature. This mini-LED backlit screen is producing a 1000-nit full brightness, peaking at 1600, and has an outstanding million-to-one contrast ratio. The blacks are black, the colours are bright. It's exceptional./nIn some ways, it's too much for the average set of eyes to appreciate./nThe processor is much the same. The utterly bonkers decision by Apple to put their M1 processor into the iPad makes this one of, if not the most powerful tablet you can buy./nThat's laptop performance. It's the same processor powering the MacBook Pro. Not unprecedented — Microsoft puts Intel Core processors in its Surface Laptops and Surface Pro Tablet — but this is a big deal for Apple./nApps launch in an instant, performance is snappy and when you lay down 4K video in an edit timeline it's like being on a desktop or pro laptop./nHowever, imagine if it ran MacOS, or a touch-enabled version of the same. Imagine if iPadOS wasn't an enhanced version of iOS but a tablet-enabled version of MacOS. Perhaps it's just me, but it seems utterly logical./nThe 2021 Apple iPad Pro goes on sale on Friday, starting at $1199 for the 11-inch model with WiFi only and 128GB of storage./nAdd in all the beans and you can pay $3549 for the 12.9-inch with 2TB of storage and 5G connectivity. Worth it, if you're a creative pro working in design, videography or photography for sure./nOtherwise, the bog-standard iPad is still a pretty amazing device that does most of what most people need for just $499.

147,First review: Apple's new iMacs - the ultimate family computer,2021-05-12 00:00:00.000000,"Four weeks ago when/nApple held their first product announcement event of 2021/none of the most unexpected announcements was a range of new iMac computers. Available in seven colours, featuring Apple's own M1 Processor, it looked like it would tick all the boxes. With a week of usage under my belt, I can tell you - it does./nNormally we'd say ""/nout of the box/n"" and give an impression. The new iMac impresses you in the box./nEnvironmentally focused, there's no big chunky Styrofoam holding this all together, instead the cardboard mechanics allowing the box to hinge apart to expose your new iMac./nREAD MORE:/nHow to tell if your smartphone is spying on you/nThen, you pick it up and it's lightweight like no other all-in-one PC. And once you rip off all the protective layers, it's beautiful./nSeven colours is a lot of options. The Green I'm using is a unique green, and I expect that's the same for all the colours. There is guaranteed to be an iMac to suit your home or office./nGreat for Families/nAnd that's the thing about this computer, it is equally suited to home or work, but I really believe this is the ultimate family computer for a family who have just the one computer, but multiple users./nEnter TouchID - something first present on the iPhone, now on iPads and MacBooks - and finally the Apple keyboard contains a TouchID sensor allowing fast login, or fast approval of your ApplePay purchase./nCritically the TouchID is also a link to your own computer account. Each member of the family can register their fingerprint, and by scanning your finger, you're asking the iMac to switch to your login./nThat very feature has changed things massively for my kids as they jump in one after the other to do their homework or typing practice./nMade for the work-from-home era/nThere's one feature on the new iMac that is surprisingly unique - a Full HD web camera. The front-facing camera on the iMac is now 1080p and that means better quality Zoom calls in an era when that's absolutely a priority./nIt's unique because it's actually quite rare still today, despite 1080 being a video format for many years, and video conferencing being hardly new, that resolution is normally reserved only for external web cameras./nPlus, the microphone array and speaker system are excellent too. Three microphones and six speakers mean the quality of both your video conferences and your everyday listening will be a class above./nApple's own Silicon/nI think the idea of Apple Silicon is lost on most, but in simple terms, there ain't no ""Intel Inside"" - instead Apple has built it's own M1 processor which now sits inside it's newest MacBooks, this iMac and the upcoming iPad Pro./nI found the performance of the M1 in day-to-day use to be outstanding. Apps launch almost instantly, the iMac powers on fast, and you never really feel yourself waiting or being left wanting./nFor 99 per cent of home users there will be no compatibility issues with the software you run. Personally, I'm still waiting for the full Adobe Suite to get upgraded to M1 compatibility but I think that's a rarity in the family home or small office scenario./nTypical Apple: You're going to need more/nWe've already got a dongle hanging down the back of the iMac to act as an SD Card reader. The iMac features 4 USB-C connectors, two of them are USB-3 and two of them are Thunderbolt. On the entry level iMac it's just two Thunderbolt connections./nThat means you're going to need a Dongle for your standard (rectangular) USB-A plugs, and for your SD cards. Ethernet isn't missing, it's actually connected via the Power brick which is a stroke of genius./nHow much is the new Apple iMac/nThe standard iMac 24 inch is $1,899, it does not feature TouchID on the keyboard, and has a 7 core GPU./nPrice it up, and you get an 8 Core GPU, the full 4 USB-C connections and Touch ID for $2,199 - double the storage to 512GB for $2,499.",https://www.9news.com.au/technology/apple-imac-review-2021/5a388e4c-e9d7-4bc8-9915-c338b9475ad2

159,"They recovered from COVID, only to die of 'black fungus.' What we know about the disease sweeping India",2021-05-12 00:00:00.000000,"In early May, doctors in India began raising the alarm about a rise in mucormycosis - a rare and potentially deadly infection also known as black fungus./nMany of those being infected are coronavirus patients, or those who have recently recovered from COVID-19, whose immune systems have been weakened by the virus or who have underlying conditions - most notably diabetes./nIn the past few weeks, thousands of black fungus cases have been reported across the country, with hundreds hospitalised and at least 90 dead./nTwo states have declared it an epidemic/n, and the central government has made it a notifiable disease./nHere's what we know about black fungus and its spread in India./nHow do you get it, and what are the symptoms?/nBlack fungus is caused by mould found in damp environments like soil or compost, and can attack the respiratory tract./nIt is not contagious and does not spread from person to person./nSeveral types of fungi can cause the disease. These fungi aren't harmful to most people, but can cause serious infections among those with weakened immune systems, according to the United States/nCentres for Disease Control and Prevention/n(CDC)./nBlack fungus commonly affects the sinuses or lungs after a person inhales fungal spores in the air, and can also affect the skin following a surface injury like a cut or burn./nSymptoms depend on where in the body the fungus is growing, but can include facial swelling, fever, skin ulcers and black lesions in the mouth./nThe disease ""begins to manifest as skin infection in the air pockets located behind our forehead, nose, cheekbones, and in between the eyes and teeth,"" the Indian Health Ministry said/nin a statement on May 14/n./n""It then spreads to eyes, lungs and can even spread to the brain. It leads to blackening or discolouration over the nose, blurred or double vision, chest pain, breathing difficulties and coughing of blood.""/n""One of the ways mucormycosis travels is by invading the blood vessels,"" Dr Hemant Thacker, consultant physician and cardiometabolic specialist at Breach Candy Hospital in Mumbai, said./n""It compromises the circulation to the distal organ, and thus produces what is called as necrosis or death of tissue, which then becomes black. So it is then given the name black fungus.""/nIn the most severe cases, the infection ""goes through the blood vessels into the brain,"" potentially causing loss of eyesight or creating a ""gaping hole"" in the face, he added./n""If not controlled, not treated, it can have a mortality (rate) of anything from 20 per cent to 50 per cent.""/nA 2005 study/nof 929 cases dating back to 1885 found an overall mortality rate of 54 per cent,/naccording to the CDC./nThe mortality rate also depends on the type of fungus involved and which part of the body is affected. For instance, it's less deadly for people with sinus infections, but more deadly for those with lung infections./nWhat is the link to COVID-19?/nImmunocompromised people are more susceptible to infection - including COVID-19 patients, diabetic patients, people who take steroids, and those with other comorbidities like cancer or organ transplants, said the Indian Health Ministry./nCOVID patients are particularly susceptible because not only does the virus affect their immune system - treatment drugs can also suppress their immune response./n""Due to these factors, COVID-19 patients face a renewed risk of failing the battle against attacks mounted by organisms such as mucormycetes,"" the ministry said, referring to the fungi that cause mucormycosis./nCOVID patients undergoing oxygen therapy in ICUs may have humidifiers in the ward - which can raise their exposure to moisture, and make them more prone to fungal infection, the ministry said./n""The fungus takes the window of opportunity, invades the body,"" Dr Thacker said./n""This body has a small opening because of COVID, because of the sugars (high glucose levels), because of the antibiotics - because of so many other things, (black fungus) gets a foothold.""/nThe ministry cautioned ""this does not mean that every COVID patient will get infected by Mucormycosis,"" as it's uncommon among those without diabetes./nAccording to India's official National Health Portal/n, the prevalence of diabetes in the country is as high as 12 per cent to 18 per cent of the adult population, especially in urban areas./n""India is the diabetic capital of the world,"" Dr Thacker said./n""We have tropical climates where the fungus festers. So all this has led to the black fungus epidemic.""/nHow do you treat it?/nBlack fungus is treated with antifungal medicines, often given intravenously,/naccording to the CDC./nThe most common medicines include Amphotericin B - a drug currently being used in Indian states to combat the outbreak./nPatients may need up to six weeks of anti-fungal medicine to recover. Their recovery depends on how early the disease was diagnosed and treated./nOften, surgery is required to cut away dead or infected tissue./n""In some patients, this may result in loss of upper jaw or sometimes even the eye,"" the Indian Health Ministry said in its statement./nDemand is rising in India for Amphotericin B - but it's in short supply, as hospitals had not anticipated the number of cases./nBhavya Reddy, a resident in India's southern Telangana state, said her father was diagnosed with black fungus on April 26 - just as he was recovering from COVID-19./n""Once he started to recover (from COVID) his face started to swell,"" Ms Reddy said./n""When the swelling did not reduce, (doctors) told us to get the injection.""/nThe hospital did not have supply of Amphotericin B, and she had to appeal to the state's chief minister to receive vials of the drug, she said./nOnce the medicine was secured, her father underwent an endoscopic sinus surgery to relieve the swelling./nMansukh Mandaviya, a junior minister of the Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilisers, tweeted on Thursday adding that five companies have been approved to produce the drug in India, in addition to an existing six./nHow common is it?/nThe disease is globally distributed, and generally pretty rare - though it can be hard to place exact estimates of its prevalence due to lack of comprehensive surveillance and data./nIn the US, laboratory surveillance in the San Fancisco Bay Area between 1992 to 1993 suggested an annual rate of 1.7 cases per million people, according to the CDC./nHowever, the disease appears to be more common in India -/none study/nby Indian microbiologists, published in March in the journal Microorganisms, suggested black fungus is 70 times more prevalent in India than in global data./nThere are several possible reasons why - there is a higher rate of ""uncontrolled diabetes"" in India, said the study./nMany patients they studied didn't even know they had diabetes until they were diagnosed with black fungus, demonstrating ""the lack of regular health check-ups in the Indian population,"" said the study./nThe black fungus mortality rate in India is also ""considerably high due to delays in seeking medical attention and diagnosing the disease, and challenges in managing the advanced stage of infection,"" said the study./nThe country's climate is also a factor, Dr Thacker said./n""This fungus can grow on the side of a bread that is kept outside,"" he said./n""It can grow anywhere in the form of a mold, but in tropical countries with the humidity ... it tends to fester.""/nThe current outbreak could also be because ""we are in summertime, it's hot, it's humid,"" he added./n""Everybody knows that fungus infection festers in these kinds of climes.""/nWhere has it been reported?/nMore than 3200 black fungus cases have so far been recorded across the five states of Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana, Telangana and Gujarat./nMaharashtra has the highest number, with more than 2000 cases reported and 800 hospitalised. At least 90 people have died of the disease in the state./nGujarat has reported at least 369 cases in just one hospital./nOn Thursday, the central government classified mucormycosis as a notifiable disease, meaning all states and union territories have to report their cases to federal authorities./n""We now have a new challenge of black fungus, we need to be cautious and prepare for it,"" Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Friday./nAt least seven states have declared black fungus a notifiable disease, in accordance with the central government's advisory to collect data, according to respective state government authorities./n""These cases are being found in patients who have recovered from COVID, so there are a number of complications,"" said JV Modi, medical superintendent at Gujarat's Ahmedabad Civil Hospital./nHe added the hospital has seen a rise of cases in the past 10 days, as the country appeared to pass the peak of its second coronavirus wave.",https://www.9news.com.au/health/covid-black-fungus-what-we-know-about-the-disease-sweeping-india/317b6ff1-2627-4cd6-a489-6d28a37e086a

We do not understand it. The scans come back negative, there's no pinched disk, there's no bulging problem.""/nHe says one of the most commonly reported consequences of acute and chronic pain is disrupted sleep./n""In chronic pain this then creates a vicious descending cycle of misery, because the person is not getting enough sleep, they're not getting rested, they're not repairing, which begets more pain… and because they've got more pain they can't sleep,"" he says./n""Many of the medicines people are placed on also disrupt sleep. If we could have one intervention that would have the greatest impact in making someone's life better, even though they continued to have profound pain, is getting a good night's sleep./n""We don't have all the answers there but that is a great challenge for the future.""/nREAD MORE:/n/nPolice officer in intense pain told there was nothing wrong/nProfessor Lormier Moseley chair of Physiotherapy at the University of South Australia, says a lot of people with back pain - most people with chronic back pain have pain that's not being caused by damage in their back./n""You speak to anyone with chronic back pain and that can be hard to believe because it feels horrible, Prof Moseley, who was also not involved in Dr Klyne's study, tells 9News./n""This is where understanding the system is so liberating.

Now I'm an adult in a spaceship... If we can do this, just imagine what you can do,"" he said./nThis flight marked only the fourth test flight of the vehicle that reached the edge of space./nSurrounding SpaceShipTwo's takeoff was — in typical Mr Branson fashion — a high-production party with friends, family, employees and a few VIPs in attendance./nEarlier on Sunday, Mr Branson tweeted a picture of himself and a barefoot Elon Musk hanging out./nGrammy-nominated artist Khalid is also expected to perform an as-yet-unreleased song on an outdoor stage./nBut asked afterward whether he is planning any more adventures, Mr Branson said he will ""definitely give it a rest for the time being"" because ""I'm not sure it would be fair to put my family through another one.""/nHe said he thinks he holds the record for being pulled out of the sea five times by helicopter./nWhat flight means/nMr Branson's flight — which came just nine days before Amazon bilionaire Jeff Bezos is slated to rocket into suborbital space aboard his own company's spacecraft — is a landmark moment for the commercial space industry./nThe up-and-coming sector has for years been seeking to make suborbital space tourism (a relatively simple straight-up-and-down flight, as opposed to orbiting the Earth for longer periods) a viable business with the aim of allowing thousands of people to experience the adrenaline rush and sweeping views of our home planet that such flights can offer./nMr Branson and Mr Bezos are situated to become direct competitors in that industry, each offering tickets to wealthy customers for brief rides to the upper atmosphere aboard supersonic, rocket-powered spacecraft./nVirgin Galactic plans to conduct just one more test flight before it will begin flying paying customers./nMore than 600 people have reserved tickets priced at $260,000 (US$200,000) to $334,000 ($US250,000) so far./nThe company is expected to reopen ticket sales soon, though at a higher price point./nMr Branson's flight also helps bolster Virgin Galactic's reputation as the ""world's first commercial spaceline.""/nThat's how the company advertised itself as it signed up those hundreds of willing customers who've waited through development delays — and a tragic mishap — for their chance to ride aboard SpaceShipTwo./nBut whether or not Virgin Galactic will really be the ""first"" commercially operational suborbital space company is not yet clear./nMr Bezos' space company, Blue Origin, appeared poised to put its founder in space before Branson, until Virgin Galactic made the surprise announcement earlier this month that he would be on the very next test flight, a departure from the company's earlier plans./nMr Bezos' flight, slated for July 20, could kick off the company's commercial operations sooner than that, and one of his fellow passengers on the flight is a paying customer, having won a ticket through a charity auction for the price of $37 million ($US28 million)./nREAD MORE:/n/nThe 82-year-old woman flying into space with Jeff Bezos/nThe company has not yet begun selling tickets to the public, however, nor has it set a specific date for when it plans to do so./nNeither company is expected to offer tickets that are affordable to the average American./nMr Branson did tease a big ""announcement"" about his effort to ""democratize space"" ahead of the flight.

The fact that I'm willing to fly with those people shows confidence,"" Mr Branson told CNN Business' Rachel Crane earlier this month.

Now I'm an adult in a spaceship... If we can do this, just imagine what you can do,"" he said./nThis flight marked only the fourth test flight of the vehicle that reached the edge of space./nSurrounding SpaceShipTwo's takeoff was — in typical Mr Branson fashion — a high-production party with friends, family, employees and a few VIPs in attendance./nEarlier on Sunday, Mr Branson tweeted a picture of himself and a barefoot Elon Musk hanging out./nGrammy-nominated artist Khalid is also expected to perform an as-yet-unreleased song on an outdoor stage./nBut asked afterward whether he is planning any more adventures, Mr Branson said he will ""definitely give it a rest for the time being"" because ""I'm not sure it would be fair to put my family through another one.""/nHe said he thinks he holds the record for being pulled out of the sea five times by helicopter./nWhat flight means/nMr Branson's flight — which came just nine days before Amazon bilionaire Jeff Bezos is slated to rocket into suborbital space aboard his own company's spacecraft — is a landmark moment for the commercial space industry./nThe up-and-coming sector has for years been seeking to make suborbital space tourism (a relatively simple straight-up-and-down flight, as opposed to orbiting the Earth for longer periods) a viable business with the aim of allowing thousands of people to experience the adrenaline rush and sweeping views of our home planet that such flights can offer./nMr Branson and Mr Bezos are situated to become direct competitors in that industry, each offering tickets to wealthy customers for brief rides to the upper atmosphere aboard supersonic, rocket-powered spacecraft./nVirgin Galactic plans to conduct just one more test flight before it will begin flying paying customers./nMore than 600 people have reserved tickets priced at $260,000 (US$200,000) to $334,000 ($US250,000) so far./nThe company is expected to reopen ticket sales soon, though at a higher price point./nMr Branson's flight also helps bolster Virgin Galactic's reputation as the ""world's first commercial spaceline.""/nThat's how the company advertised itself as it signed up those hundreds of willing customers who've waited through development delays — and a tragic mishap — for their chance to ride aboard SpaceShipTwo./nBut whether or not Virgin Galactic will really be the ""first"" commercially operational suborbital space company is not yet clear./nMr Bezos' space company, Blue Origin, appeared poised to put its founder in space before Branson, until Virgin Galactic made the surprise announcement earlier this month that he would be on the very next test flight, a departure from the company's earlier plans./nMr Bezos' flight, slated for July 20, could kick off the company's commercial operations sooner than that, and one of his fellow passengers on the flight is a paying customer, having won a ticket through a charity auction for the price of $37 million ($US28 million)./nREAD MORE:/n/nThe 82-year-old woman flying into space with Jeff Bezos/nThe company has not yet begun selling tickets to the public, however, nor has it set a specific date for when it plans to do so./nNeither company is expected to offer tickets that are affordable to the average American./nMr Branson did tease a big ""announcement"" about his effort to ""democratize space"" ahead of the flight.

The fact that I'm willing to fly with those people shows confidence,"" Mr Branson told CNN Business' Rachel Crane earlier this month.

Yes, of course,"" said the official, who said there was never discussion about pulling the plug on the party./n""We're moving ahead, with this event, with the initiatives, with trying to get people vaccinated. All of it.""/nMr Biden hoped to proclaim this weekend that 70 per cent of American adults had received at least one COVID-19 shot. But officials acknowledged more than a week ago the goal wouldn't be met as they struggle to convince still-resistant Americans to get shots./nAbout 67 per cent of Americans 18 and older had received at least one shot, according to CDC data reported Saturday./nFor Mr Biden and his aides, reality is setting in that getting the entire country vaccinated will be the work of his entire presidency - and that pockets of the nation where vaccination rates remain low will continue to suffer outbreaks that hamper the nationwide recovery effort./nMost US adults who plan to get vaccinated against COVID-19 have already done so, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation report released this week./nWhile they have declined to rule it out, officials do not currently expect Biden to set any more numerical goals when it comes to vaccinations, given the US has still not reached his last one and the pace of vaccinations has slowed significantly, according to people familiar with the discussions./nInstead, officials plan to simply push to get as many Americans vaccinated as soon as possible./nA recent CNN analysis of the most recent vaccination data from the CDC finds that more than one in 10 Americans have missed their second shot. Officials say it is more vital than ever that Americans receive their second dose of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine, since protection against the Delta strain is dramatically bolstered with the additional dose./nNew questions have also emerged over whether mask mandates could return should the variant cause a spike in cases - a possibility the White House has sought to publicly dispel after trumpeting the lifting of mask recommendations earlier this spring./nDr Rochelle Walensky, the director of the CDC, said Thursday the Delta variant of coronavirus remains a serious threat in the United States and could cause more COVID-19 cases, hospitalisations and deaths in unvaccinated communities - especially those in the Southeast and Midwest./n""Looking state by state and county by county, it is clear that communities where people remain unvaccinated are communities that remain vulnerable,"" Dr Walensky said./n'It will be better next year'/nShe said as the Delta variant continues to spread in the US, the nation has seen a recent increase in its seven-day average of COVID-19 cases./nOn Wednesday, the CDC reported 14,875 new cases of COVID-19. The nation's current seven-day average is about 12,600 cases per day./nMr Biden said Friday he is not concerned about another widespread COVID outbreak - but acknowledged he was wary of unvaccinated people catching the Delta variant at holiday gatherings./n""I am concerned that people who have not gotten vaccinated have the capacity to catch the variant and spread it to other people who have not been vaccinated,"" Mr Biden told reporters at an event on the economy./n""I am not concerned that there's going to be a major outbreak.""/nMr Biden reiterated his fears that ""lives will be lost"" should more people continue to resist getting vaccines./n""Don't think about yourself, think about your family. Think about those around you,"" he said./n""That is what we should be thinking about today. The Fourth of July this year is different than the Fourth of July last year and it will be better next year.""/nIn some ways, this weekend is the moment Mr Biden predicted two months into his presidency, standing in the Cross Hall of the White House./n""If we do our part, if we do this together, by July the Fourth there's a good chance you, your families and friends will be able to get together in your backyard or in your neighbourhood and have a cookout and a barbecue and celebrate Independence Day,"" Mr Biden said in March, a long red carpet stretching behind him, setting a months-away goal for returning the country to normal./nOfficials insist the relative normalcy of this year's holiday compared to the months spent under social distancing and mask restrictions was a signal Mr Biden's strategy had worked./n""The Fourth of July is a moment for us to step back and celebrate our progress. We have made tremendous progress in our fight against the virus,"" said Jeff Zients, the President's coronavirus response coordinator./nREAD MORE:/n/nCriminal charges expected for Donald Trump's company, finance chief/n""At the same time,"" he went on, ""there's a lot more work to do.""/nMuch of that work has shifted to states where the combination of low vaccination rates and high caseloads have caused fears of backsliding./n""We are now going in the wrong direction yet again with COVID-19 infections here in the state of Arkansas,"" said Dr Cam Patterson, chancellor at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, during the state's weekly briefing last week./n'The message is: Get vaccinated'/nHoping to target the regional outbreaks, the White House said last week it was deploying response teams to conduct surge testing, provide therapeutics like monoclonal antibodies and deploy federal personnel to areas that need support staff for vaccinations./nThe White House coronavirus team is spearheading the effort and officials expect the teams will help with everything from boosting testing and providing supplies to potentially increasing paid media efforts targeting regions where vaccinations are low./nStill, while the response teams are being sent to prop up communities, officials believe vaccinations are the number one way to stop the spread and recognise there could be a limit to their efforts./nAlready, the administration has shifted its strategy from focusing on mass vaccination sites to more targeted efforts to get people shots. Health officials have narrowed their focus to young people in particular, who account for a large number of the still-unvaccinated. They also remain focused on minorities, whose vaccination rates lag behind the white population./nRecognising the concern over the variant, the Biden administration flooded television networks with top federal health officials last week to address concerns ahead of the July 4th weekend./nAnd officials sought to balance what is undoubtedly a moment to mark progress against the virus with the nagging problem that large swaths of the country still appear resistant to vaccines./n""You can still celebrate at the same time as you get your message very, very clear: if you were vaccinated, you have a high degree of protection. If you are not, you should wear a mask, and you should think very seriously about getting vaccinated,"" Dr Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said on Thursday./n""So, in so many respects, nothing has really changed,"" Dr Fauci said./n""We are celebrating as a country at the same time as we recognise the fact that we're in a serious situation for those who have not been vaccinated.

In addition to national defence, so much of our life on Earth — from digital communications to navigation — depends on satellites in space./nREAD MORE:/nAustralia taking China to trade watchdog over wine tariffs/nFollowing the demise of the Soviet Union's space program, the US has enjoyed a period of unparalleled leadership in space. But in recent years, US/nobservers/nand/npoliticians/nhave warned that America's dominance could soon be challenged by China's fast-growing space capabilities./nThat concern has only deepened with a series of important and high-profile Chinese achievements: In 2019, it became the/nfirst country to land on the far side of the moon/n; last year, it successfully put into orbit its final Beidou satellite, setting the stage to challenge the US Global Positioning System (GPS); and last month, it became the only country after the US to put a functioning rover on Mars./nThat particular breakthrough prompted NASA's new administrator Bill Nelson to warn against American complacency in face of China's space ambitions./nREAD MORE:/nNew photos show Chinese rover's exploration of Mars/n/nAt a House hearing/nlast month, he held up an image taken by the Chinese rover on Mars, called China ""a very aggressive competitor,"" and lobbied Congress to fund NASA's plans to bring humans back to the moon./nDespite its advancements, China's space technology still lags behind the US. But China's space program is flush with political and monetary support from the ruling Communist Party, which views its success as a key measure of its intentional standing and domestic legitimacy./nLast week, US-China competition in space entered a new phase when/nthree Chinese astronauts arrived on the country's still-under-construction space station/nfor a three-month stay. The only other space station in orbit is the International Space Station (ISS), a US-led collaboration with Russia, Europe, Japan and Canada./nFor the past 23 years, the ISS has been visited by/nmore than 200 astronauts from 19 countries/n— except China. Since 2011, NASA has been effectively banned from cooperating with China, after Congress passed the Wolf Amendment due to espionage-related concerns./nThat exclusion has at least in part spurred Beijing to build its own space station, the Tiangong, which is expected to be completed by the end of next year — two years before the ISS is scheduled to be decommissioned in 2024./nREAD MORE:/nClogged ports in China could deal blow to end-of-year shopping/nIf the US and its international partners do not decide to extend the ISS's operational life, China's Tiangong space station may soon become the only crewed outpost in orbit — one that NASA astronauts are barred from joining by US law./nWhile the ISS was primarily a US-Russian venture born out of the ashes of the Cold War, China's Tiangong is being built amid talks of a new Cold War. And it is likely that in the years to come, alliances in space will increasingly mirror the geopolitical lines on Earth./nAlready, Chinese space officials have made clear they wish to welcome foreign astronauts aboard its space station upon completion. China is also joining hands with Russia to build/na joint research station/non the moon's south pole by 2035 — a facility that will be open to international participation./nThe US, meanwhile, is building its own international coalition to establish basic principles for safe and responsible lunar explorations.

414,"In North Korea a packet of coffee costs $100, and that's a problem for Kim Jong Un",2021-06-12 00:00:00.000000,"North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has bigger problems than the United States right now. He needs to feed his people, and his options are not good./nThe ruler of the secretive, hereditary communist dictatorship opened an important political meeting on Tuesday acknowledging the grim situation his country now faces. North Korea's food supply is strained and ""getting tense,"" Kim said, according to the country's state-run newswire, KCNA./nThe agriculture sector is still recovering from storm damage incurred last year. Replacing domestic food supplies with imports will likely be difficult because borders remain mostly closed due to COVID-19 restrictions./nIn the capital Pyongyang, prices of some staple goods are reportedly skyrocketing. Experts say rice and fuel prices are relatively stable still but imported staples such as sugar, soybean oil and flour prices have gone up./nThe costs associated with some locally produced staples have also soared in recent months. Potato prices have tripled at the well-known Tongil market, where both locals and foreigners can shop, Pyongyang residents said./nResidents also revealed that non staple items such as a small packet of black tea can sell for around A$90, while a packet of coffee can fetch more than A$130./nKim did not disclose the scale of the shortages, but the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) recently estimated North Korea is short of approximately 860,000 tons of food, or equivalent to just over two months of nationwide supplies./nThe situation was serious enough in April for Kim to urge North Koreans to undertake another ""arduous march,"" the term used to refer to the devastating famine in North Korea in the 1990s that killed hundreds of thousands of people./nThe admission that the state's centrally planned economy cannot even feed its people may seem out of place for a leader whose family are portrayed in propaganda as infallible and almost God-like./nBut, unlike his father and predecessor, Kim hasn't been afraid to admit mistakes or failure -- or even cry in front his people./nKim has fashioned his domestic image as a man of the people, a leader constantly meeting with the public and dedicated to improving the everyday lives of one of the most impoverished countries on the planet. His stated goal since taking power in 2011 was to improve the lives of most North Koreans./nHowever, short of drastically altering North Korea's inefficient centrally planned economy, freeing the nearly 120,000 political prisoners believed to be held in gulags, or pulling back on its nuclear weapons program, experts believe Pyongyang will struggle to achieve Kim's aim./nRelations with Washington and negotiations on sanctions relief appear to be a distant concern, at least for now. Kim did not mention talks with the United States until Thursday, day three of this week's important political meeting and item four of the agenda./nAccording to state media, Kim reportedly analysed US President Joe Biden's North Korea policy and now believes Pyongyang needs to ""get prepared for both dialogue and confrontation.""/nWhile not exactly reassuring, Kim's attitude toward the US was less hostile than the series of provocative statements released by KCNA last month, one of which warned of a ""crisis beyond control."" Kim also referred to the US as North Korea's biggest enemy in January./nIn fact, the statement may crack open the door to talks with Washington, which attempted in vain to reach out to Pyongyang earlier this year./nAfter the two sides failed to reach a deal at former President Donald Trump's summit with Kim in Hanoi in 2019, North Korean propaganda repeatedly noted that the country was not interested in more talks unless Washington changed it's so-called ""hostile policy"" toward Pyongyang./nThe Biden administration has made it clear that North Korea, its nuclear program and allegations of large-scale human rights abuses in the country are an important part of its foreign policy agenda./nThe White House completed a months-long policy review in late April, and Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga and South Korean President Moon Jae-in -- US allies with a stake in North Korea's future -- were the first two leaders to visit Biden in the US. Sung Kim, the new US special representative for North Korea policy, is traveling to Seoul on Saturday for talks with his South Korean and Japanese counterparts./nThough the White House says it plans to pursue a ""calibrated, practical approach"" that differs from the strategies employed by the Trump and Obama administrations, North Korea remains the same intractable foreign policy issue that has bedevilled Biden's recent predecessors./nAnd like Kim, Biden arguably has more pressing issues on his plate right now. The President's legislative agenda appears to be stalling in a deadlocked Congress.

They listened to the online verdict from their home in London./n“We still feel that the circumstances surrounding Nora’s death were suspicious,"" the teen’s mother, Meabh Quoirin, told Irish broadcaster RTE Radio./n""But in terms of what’s legally available to us, an open verdict was incredibly important in our quest for justice for Nora, and that’s what we got today.”/nThe teen disappeared at the Dusun eco-resort in southern Negeri Sembilan state on August 4, 2019, a day after the family arrived for a vacation./nAfter a massive search, her body was found on August 13 beside a stream on a palm oil estate about 2.5 kilometres from the resort./nThe coroner had ruled out homicide, natural death and suicide and said she likely got lost after leaving her family’s cottage on her own, and that no one else was involved./nPolice have said there was no evidence of foul play, but her parents said she wouldn't have wandered off on her own./nThey told the inquest that a third party could have dumped her body in the area following the search for her. The coroner had described the family’s suggestions as “nothing more than probably theory” with no evidence./nNora was wearing only underwear when she went missing at night, but her body was found naked. The coroner noted the family’s contention that this gave credence to the possibility of sexual assault but said an extensive autopsy found no such proof or evidence of a struggle or smothering./nThe coroner also said there were no suspicious circumstances prior to the teenager’s disappearance, no ransom request and no signs of intrusion into the family’s cottage./nTo get from the resort to the place where her body was found, Judge Azizul said Nora would have had to cross rocky streams and navigate hilly roads in terrain that is challenging even for well-equipped adults. He noted she was shy, attached to her parents and not a curious child./n“I am willing to accept that on the evidence before the court the possibility of third party involvement was lower than the possibility that Nora Anne had somehow inadvertently gotten herself into a situation from which she could not extricate herself,"" he said./n“That does not mean however, that I should enter a verdict of misadventure ... given the evidence that was before the court, I fail to see how it could have been said that it was more probable than not that Nora Anne had died as a result of misadventure,"" he said./nThe family had cited unidentified fingerprints on the outside of a window in their cottage that was found open on the morning of her disappearance, the initial failure of hundreds of trained rescuers to find her, and police dogs unable to follow her scent./nThey feared possible DNA evidence was lost because of the lapsed time and the finding of her body in water, and noted a lack of major physical damage to her body that would have been likely from walking through the rough terrain./nThey also said the possibility of sexual assault remained, even though there was no evidence of violent assault, and that her highly submissive nature ruled out any struggle./nA British pathologist who performed a second autopsy on her body in the United Kingdom testified that he agreed with the Malaysian findings that she died of intestinal bleeding due to starvation and stress./nHowever, he said he couldn’t fully rule out sexual assault due to severe body decomposition.",https://www.9news.com.au/world/nora-anne-quoirin-malaysian-court-rejects-coroners-verdict-in-teens-death/93bb2171-e0b9-4c0a-8f6d-1400eaae0ce0

The seven were hanged for war crimes just before Christmas in 1948, three years after Japan’s defeat./nThe discovery brings partial closure to a painful chapter of Japanese history that still plays out today, as conservative Japanese politicians attempt to whitewash history, leading to friction with wartime victims, especially China and South Korea./nAfter years spent verifying and checking details and evaluating the significance of what he'd found, Nihon University Professor Hiroaki Takazawa publicly released the clues to the remains' location last week./nHe came across the declassified documents in 2018 at the US National Archives in Maryland. It’s believed to be the first time official documents showing the handling of the seven war criminals’ remains were made public, according to Japan's National Institute for Defence Studies and the Japan Centre for Asian Historical Records./nREAD MORE:/n/n'It doesn't make any difference': Australian WWII POW turns 100/nHidetoshi Tojo, the leader's great-grandson, told The Associated Press that the absence of the remains has long been a humiliation for the bereaved families, but he's relieved the information has come to light./n“If his remains were at least scattered in Japanese territorial waters - I think he was still somewhat fortunate,” Mr Tojo said. “I want to invite my friends and lay flowers to pay tribute to him"" if further details about the remains' location becomes available./nHideki Tojo, prime minister during much of World War II, is a complicated figure, revered by some conservatives as a patriot but loathed by many in the West for prolonging the war, which ended only after the US atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki./nAbout a month after August 15, 1945, when then-Emperor Hirohito announced Japan’s defeat to a stunned nation, Tojo shot himself in a failed suicide attempt as he was about to be arrested at his modest Tokyo home./nTakazawa, the Nihon University professor specialising in war tribunal issues, found the documents during research at the US archives into other war crimes trials./nThe documents, he said, are valuable because they officially detail previously little-known facts about what happened and provide a rough location of where the ashes were scattered./nHe plans to continue research into other executions. More than 4,000 people were convicted of war crimes in other international tribunals, and about 920 of them were executed./nTojo and the six others who were hanged were among 28 Japanese wartime leaders tried for war crimes at the 1946-1948 International Military Tribunal for the Far East./nREAD MORE:/n/nWWII era plane makes emergency landing near Florida beach/nTwenty-five were convicted, including 16 sentenced to life in prison, with two getting shorter prison terms.

The caskets were unloaded from the truck and placed directly “in the ovens” in 10 minutes, while soldiers guarded the area./nThe remains were then transported under guard to a nearby airstrip and loaded onto a plane that Major Frierson boarded./n“We proceeded to a point approximately (50 kilometres) over the Pacific Ocean east of Yokohama where I personally scattered the cremated remains over a wide area.”/nToday, even without the ashes, bereaved families and conservative Japanese lawmakers such as former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe regularly pay tribute at Tokyo’s Yasukuni Shrine, where the executed war criminals are enshrined with 2.5 million war dead considered “sacred spirits” in the Shinto religion. No remains are enshrined at Yasukuni./nAfter the seven executed war criminals were enshrined there in 1978, Yasukuni has become a flashpoint between Japan and its neighbours China and South Korea, who see the enshrinement as proof of Japan’s lack of remorse over its wartime aggression./nYasukuni also enshrines five other convicted wartime leaders and hundreds of other war criminals./nREAD MORE:/n/nPerth auction house under fire for 'twisted' sale of Adolf Hitler items/nHidetoshi Tojo said his great-grandfather was consistently made a taboo in postwar Japan, never glorified./n“Everything about my great-grandfather was sealed, including his speeches.

Let's hope so,"" he said./nHow long has NZ relied on these cables?/nSubmarine cables aren't an engineering achievement that came in the order one might expect./nThe first transcontinental cable was laid between Britain and the United States in 1858, allowing telegrams to be sent between the countries for the first time using Morse code along its seven twisted copper wires./nQueen Victoria and US president James Buchanan used it to exchange telegrams several years before the invention of the humble stapler in 1877, and 18 years before anyone stepped into anything resembling a motor car./nREAD MORE:/n/nWorld-first laser to shunt deadly space junk out of orbit/nNow the world's oceans are criss-crossed by more than a million kilometres of submarine cables, linking billions of kilometres of fibre on land./nThe more modern submarine cables, laid after about 1988, contain several strands of glass fibre, rather than a copper wire, to carry their traffic./nHow do they work?/nThe way fibre-optic cables transmit information is by having light shone down them that can be detected at the other end, in the same way that you might communicate with someone using a torch across a darkened field at night./nThe modern miracle is not so much the cables themselves, but the lasers and switching equipment at either end of the cables that can flick on and off and detect those flashes of light, in different wavelengths, at mind-boggling speeds./nIt is that optical electronics, along with the number of strands of fibre, that determines how much information a cable can carry./nAt the moment, the highest-capacity submarine cables have transfer rates in the tens of terabits, but as faster switching equipment is developed and commercialised that should further increase, allowing both new and sometimes also existing cables to carry more data./nThis year, researchers in Japan reportedly sent a petabit (1000 terabits) of data down a single optical fibre in a second./nThat's enough bandwidth in theory to transfer all the works of William Shakespeare to 250,000 different people in a hundredth of a second (uncompressed), or to simultaneously stream Netflix in HD to 200 million people./nREAD MORE:/n/nThe first-ever tweet sold as an NFT for $3.8 million/nIf they are glass, will they last forever?/nIf a few strands of glass fibre were all that submarine cables comprised of, then they might last almost forever, but sadly that's not the case./nThe light signals they carry need a boost about every 60km, using ""repeaters"" that are attached to every undersea cable, just as you might need a plug-in device to extend a wi-fi signal to a distant corner of your home./nThe repeaters need power to provide that boost, which means every submarine fibre-optic cable also carries a copper power cable alongside its fibre strands./nThat equipment limits the working life of cables to a few decades./nPower for the repeaters is usually provided by diesel generators at landing stations along the way, which has the practical effect that undersea cables need to come ashore about every 10,000km./nREAD MORE:/n/nSpeed boost for 900,000 inferior NBN internet connections/nHow are they laid?/nA few things haven't changed much since the 19th century./nAs there is no machine to do it, cables – sometimes thousands of kilometres long – are wound by hand around huge spools in special cable-laying ships, like giant spools of cotton, in a process that can take several laborious weeks, before they are lowered on to the seabed./nThe final few kilometres before they come ashore are usually buried, to protect them from being dragged up and cut by ship anchors./nWhat is their economic significance?/nThe most meaningful measure perhaps is that submarine cables underpin pretty much all international communications that take place today, and most have large amounts of ""unlit"" excess capacity./nThat capacity is the reason people can now video-call friends and relatives on the other side of the world for free, using services such as Skype and WhatsApp​./nWithout fibre-optic submarine cables, that just wouldn't be possible./nPhone calls, internet traffic and television pictures can be relayed from one continent to another by satellites in space, but not nearly as cheaply or efficiently, so subsea cables are here to stay./nSubsea cables can cost tens of millions to many hundreds of millions of dollars, depending on their length./nSo traditionally they have been laid by large telecommunications companies such as – in this neck of the woods – Telstra​, Optus, TGP and Spark./nBut cloud computing giants such as Google, Microsoft and Amazon have increasingly been getting in on the act to help link their global data centres./nWho's behind NZ's cables?/nThe first modern fibre-optic network connecting New Zealand with Australia and the US, the Southern Cross Cable Network, shaped in a figure of eight centred on Hawaii, was completed by a Spark-led joint venture in 2000 at a cost of US$1.3 billion ($1.68 billion)./nFor many years it held a near monopoly on the flow of traffic to and from New Zealand./nBut in the past few years there has been a flurry of activity./nIn 2017, Spark, Vodafone and Telstra clubbed together to build an extra fibre line, the Tasman Global Access cable, to Australia./nThe following year, independent operator Hawaiki Cable completed a NZ$500m ($464 million) cable to the US and Australia./nHawaiki is now hoping to lay the first international submarine cable from the South Island, to Sydney and Melbourne, to support its investment in a huge data centre near Invercargill./nAnd Southern Cross is refreshing its network with its new Next trans-Pacific cable due to be in service next year./nAre they reliable?/nAfter the first transatlantic telegrams were sent in 1858, there was a large street parade on Broadway in New York to celebrate, and unused sections of the cable were chopped up to make popular souvenirs./nNowadays people are only likely to pay much attention to submarine cables if they suddenly stop working, which is a very rare occurrence./nAnd that's just as well, as it could take weeks to send a specialist repair ship to fix a cable if it broke far out to sea./nEarthquakes, as well as ship anchors, have damaged and broken submarine cables, but that's unusual, and New Zealand now has enough cables coming ashore in different places, with enough excess capacity, for no single outage to risk sending the country back to the pre-internet age./nIf a single cable was knocked out of action, communications traffic could quite easily be rerouted, though it might run slower./nBut if they were all suddenly cut, that would be pretty much it for the internet until they were fixed./nWhat are the risks of that?/nAccording to Britain's/nEnglish Historical Review/n, Britain's very first military action after declaring war on Germany in World War I was to cut five cables linking Germany with France, Spain and the Azores./nAnd in recent years, concerns have grown that subsea cable could become an easy target in a global conflict that perhaps fell short of an actual war./nThere is evidence also that subsea cables have been spied on, or at least that the ability to interfere with them has been tested./nThe Russian spy ship Yantar and the US nuclear submarine Jimmy Carter are two of the vessels that are believed to have been modified specifically for such operations./nSurprisingly, it can be possible to ""read"" the data on a fibre-optic cable by bending it and detecting the tiny amount of light that will travel straight ahead and leak out through its plastic casing./nBut then any submarine spy has got the challenge of how to make sense of all those terabits of encrypted data, deep under the ocean./nInternetNZ's Mr Sargeant has another concern./nThe ransomware attack on the Colonial Pipeline fuel pipeline in the US earlier this month shows how critical infrastructure can be attacked by ""talented criminal groups"", he said./nThe implications of submarine cable operators suffering a similar fate are reducing as the number of cables to New Zealand increases and the risk of a successful attack is remote, he said./n""But having said that, it is not impossible,"" he said./nThis story originally appeared on/n/nStuff.co.nz/n/nand has been
